The repository I looked at is called "Hollywood Studios Barely Promoted Non-White Actors and Films" by FiveThirtyEight. 
Studios invest heavily in advertising and promotional campaigns and for their films and actors to influence the Academy members who vote on Oscar nominations and win, according to the story. 
Therefore, the journalist wanted to quantify those nomination campaigns to see if it guarantees a desired nomination.
The interesting thing is the journalist actually went through each release between certain period and inventoried every "For Your Consideration" advertisement appearing in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. 
 He found 363 ads and wrote down the size, page of each ad, and photographed them and included them in GitHub project folder. 
 The table consisted of simple seven columns with details. To me, this is a great example of how journalists can create their own database for stories they want to cover.
